# Brainfuck2Web
C code to produce Javascript from Brainfuck that can be run in browser. Based on rdebath work. Althrough this is not going to be updated, project was migrated to Esoteric repository from it's own.
Too bad it's using Gnu Virus License, in MEdit repository you can check out why it's bad.
