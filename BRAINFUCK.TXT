This file is associated with BRAINFUCK.ASM.

Creating application: `copy brainfuk.com+program.bf output.com`

Specification:

8-bit, 510 cells
max code size is 32K
one extra terminating space character is required
no newline character conversions on i/o
when redirecting file something may fuck up

Any ideas on making this smaller are welcome.

This thing may appear in Brainfuck Builder 3/4, whenever I'll want to update it.
