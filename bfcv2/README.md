# BFCv2

BFCv2 is [brainfuck][bf] compiler that transforms source code (in brainfuck)
and compiles it using GCC. At the moment, it's linux only. Smaller but
less optimizing version is located in this repo (before this file was in Obfuscated repo). 

Compiled programs run at full speed, as of many optimizations made by compiler (GCC)
and other compiler (BFCv2)

I've took over skeeto/bfc repo as of authors permission.

While bf-x86 took over original project which is older than github itself,
this fork was made to anyone wanting to modify code have such right (as BFC is
archived now and nobody cares about it)

## Usage

    Use -V and -h for ussage information.
    
    
This was historically part of BFCv2 repo.
