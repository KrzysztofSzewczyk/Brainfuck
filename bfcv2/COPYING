This project WAS licensed under GPL, but project only author
permitted me (not indirectly) to change project's license.

"I haven't touched this project in about 10 years. At this point I don't
think there's any value in it, and that it isn't worth salvaging. I only
keep it around for posterity, to look back at where I was at this point
in my programming career. So I just want my repository frozen like it
was, flaws and all.

If you find this interesting and want to run with it yourself, go ahead!
Make it your own. I'll even change the license if you like, since I use
the public domain for all much open source stuff now-a-days.

However, a few years ago I made a far more interesting project that
directly generates machine code. You might want to look at that instead:

Current license is located under LICENSE.
