# Esoteric
This repo contains some of my Brainfuck & Subleq Experiments, programs, tools and even games. Be sure to check it out!
Every directory will contain README.md with installation and compilation instructions.

There are also a few sister projects: asmbf and Izmit 1 thru 4.

## Why the repo is archived.
The collective way of calling all of my esoteric work "Esoteric" isn't quite right. I've decided to create multiple
github repositories for each of my projects. All the small stuff will be left here intact (until something very bad
happens).
