# Subleq
Some of my subleq stuff, featuring parts of C stdlib and way more (well, subleq is time consuming, that explains amount of items in this repo)!
WARNING: alloca function allocates chunks that get invalidated, so pointer is no longer valid and memory is allocated by commands, so overwriting it is risky. It's NOT recommended to use alloca, use locals instead.
Historically, this content was in another repo, so commit history will not be viewable using Esoteric commit browser, so they are embedded as screenshot below. Names are self-explainationary.
